Solves [Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) using an automated browser and custom constraint based solver.

Currently has one frontend and two backends:
- (Frontend) Google builtin minesweeper game automated with selenium
- (Backend) Adhoc constraint based solver written in python
- (Backend) Generalised constraint based solver written in haskell (with psuedo proofs for its moves)
